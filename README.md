This is the group project from the U of T course *CSC343 - Introduction to Databases*, which conducted a bank marketing campaign analysis using **PostgreSQL** and **Pandas**.

## Introduction

This project focuses on exploring multiple investigative questions using a real, open dataset of customers information from a Portuguese banking institution as follows:

- designed a relational schema capable of representing the dataset using common-sense principles
- implemented a relational schema using the SQL Data Definition Language
- cleaned this dataset using Pandas to prepare it for importing into a PostgreSQL database
- Used the SQL Data Definition Language to explore the dataset and answer questions about it
- Presented technical material to a technical audience

## Overview of phases
We have the 4 phases:

#### Phase 1
The domain of interest (Bank Marketing Campaign) was identified and the corresponding dataset was chosen. Designed and documented the relational schema, and came up with three investigative questions.

#### Phase 2
Implemented the schema in detail, recorded with design decisions. Cleaned up the dataset and imported it into a PostgreSQL database. 

#### Phase 3
Wrote SQL queries to explore the investigative questions, and made connections across tables to come up with follow-up questions. Discussed and reported what was learned about the domain, results and conclusions.

#### Phase 4
Presented the results, things that are interesting, challenges and lessons for the whole project.

## Discussion
Based on what was done for these phases, in the end, we were able to conclude on the right target population to be chosen by the banks to make a campaign more effective, and the way of reducing banksâ€™ risk of having customers default on credit.
